# Stock Hawk
Stock Hawk is a stock portfolio app that allows users to search, add, and track stocks over a period of time. This app was build on top of a starter code provided by Udacity (link below). 



This is the starter code for project 3 in Udacity's [Android Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801).
